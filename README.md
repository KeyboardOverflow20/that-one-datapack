# [Unnamed Datapack]

## What is this file for?
This is the main branch. Bleeding edge stuff available on the respective branch.
Pretty sure this file won't be read by Minecraft so I'm still putting this file here. Just...make sure to remove it when you play.

## License (lol)
Not licensed (yet! whoops)

May be licensed with GNU GPL v3. Or in the public domain. I don't know, honestly!

## What is this datapack for?
Testing with Minecraft. /give, /effect, /entitydata, you name it. Plus other useful stuff for servers (probably).
