# [Unnamed Datapack]

## â„¹ DATAPACK IS ARCHIVED FOR THE TIME BEING 
Reason for archival: Developer doesn't have time

## What is this file for?
This is the BLEEDING EDGE branch. World destruction/corruption is possible, so remember to back them up.
Pretty sure this file won't be read by Minecraft so I'm putting this here. Just...make sure to remove it when you play.

## License (no, seriously)
Not licensed (yet! whoops)

May be licensed with GNU GPL v3. Or in the public domain. I don't know, honestly!

## What is this datapack for?
Testing with Minecraft. /give, /effect, /entitydata, you name it. Plus other useful stuff for servers (probably).

## Maintainers
Current maintainers of this project are:
- @UnderSet (former repository owner)

## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why make a Minecraft datapack instead of a Forge/Fabric mod?

A: I don't know enough Java and also because making a mod can break Minecraft to unplayable levels (or even unlaunchable too!).

Q: Where's the code?

A: I am making it. Be patient (seriously).
