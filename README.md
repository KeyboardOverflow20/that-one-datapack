# [Unnamed Datapack]

## What is this file for?
This is the main branch. May add a BLEEDING EDGE branch sometime but not now.
Pretty sure this file won't be read by Minecraft so I'm putting this here. Just...make sure to remove it when you play.

## License (I'm serious)
Not licensed (yet! whoops)

May be licensed with GNU GPL v3. Or in the public domain. I don't know, honestly!

## What is this datapack for?
Testing with Minecraft. /give, /effect, /entitydata, you name it. Plus other useful stuff for servers (probably).

## Maintainers
Current maintainers of this project are:

## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why make a Minecraft datapack instead of a Forge/Fabric mod?
A: I don't know enough Java and also because making a mod can break Minecraft to unplayable.
